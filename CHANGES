Ked Password Manager: CHANGES 
=============================

Noteworthy changes in Ked Password Manager. Most recent changes are at
the top.

Version 0.5.0 (Upcoming)
========================

    * Translation infrastructure and Russian translation added. Now it
      is possible to translate KedPM to any language using usual gettext
      tools.

    * Changing of database master password implemented.

    * Database exports

    * Find command

    * Add -p and -t options to add passwords through an external editor or with a template

    * Hide passwords behind colors on terminal to eliminate shoulder-surfing.

    * Project migrated to git and https://redmine.koumbit.net/projects/kedpm

Version 0.4.0 (2004.02.29) 
==========================

    * Search entry automatically gets focus when switching to flat view.

    * First password in root category creation bug fixed. GTK warnings
      should be gone too. (SF BUG #862551)

    * Location of the FPM password database file is configurable in
      options ('fpm-database' setting).

    * KedPM has got icons! Artwork done by Eugene Morozov. Thanks
      Eugene!

    * Parser patterns editor added.

    * CLI frontend remembers command history between runs.

    * Support for password trees of arbitrary depth in Figaro
      databases. This feature is not supported by FPM itself, although
      databases with subcategories should still be readable by FPM. (SF
      BUG #845305)

    * Saving history of searches in GUI. The feature is similar to
      browser url bar history.

    * Better completion in CLI.

    * Password list columns in GUI are now sortable and resizable.

Version 0.3.1 (2003-10-27)
==========================

    * Fixed password database initialization problem. New databases
      should be created normally now.

Version 0.3.0 (2003-10-26)
==========================

    * Searching is case insensitive (as it should be).

    * Configuration infrastructure implemented. For now only one
      configuration option exists: ``save-mode``.

    * Deleting of passwords implemented.

    * ``rmdir`` and ``mv`` commands were added to CLI (Patch #825957).
      Thanks Indygena!

    * Parser feature added. It will help you incorporate passwords from
      your e-mails to database more efficiently.

    * Support for fpm-0.58 databases with longer passwords (up to
      256 characters). Not tested yet.

    * GUI now can display password as plain text. It is useful when you
      need to send password to someone.

    * Added ability to search whole password tree in one operation. The
      feature accessed through "Flatten" button in GUI and through "-r"
      flag in "show" command in CLI.

    * Various CLI and GUI usability enhancements.

Version 0.2.5 (2003-09-21)
==========================

    * Fixed fpm long password bug. Figaro password manager can't handle
      passwords longer that 24 characters. Ked Password manager will allow
      you to save such long passwords, but it will break fpm compatibility
      - fpm will not handle such passwords correctly.

    * GUI now can initialize a Figaro database.

Version 0.2.0 (2003-09-14)
==========================

    * Added graphical user interface (GUI) frontend

    * Added ability to rename password categories

    * ``kedpm-cli`` script renamed to ``kedpm``. To run GUI, use 
      ``kedpm -g``; to run CLI, use ``kedpm -c``.

Version 0.1.0 (2003-08-20)
==========================

    * Added ability to save the password database in fpm-compatible
      format.  If KedPM detects that it had opened a database saved by
      FPM, it makes a backup to ~/.fpm/fpm.kedpm.bak;
    
    * Improved command line interface: overall usability improvements; 
    
    * New cli commands: 'mkdir', 'new', 'edit' and 'save';

Version 0.0.2 (2003-08-05)
==========================

    * First public release. All it can do is read Figaro Password
      Manager database files and display passwords to user via cli
      interface;
