Noteworthy changes in Ked Password Manager. Most recent changes are at
the top.

Version 0.2.5 (??)

    * Fixed fpm long password bug. Figaro password manager can't handle
    passwords longer that 24 characters. Ked Password manager will allow
    you to save such long passwords, but it will break fpm compatibility
    - fpm will not handle such passwords correctly.

    * GUI now can initialise Figaro database.

Version 0.2.0 (2003-09-14)

    * Added graphical user interface (GUI) frontend

    * Added ability to rename password categories

    * ``kedpm-cli`` script renamed to ``kedpm``. To run GUI, use 
    ``kedpm -g``; to run CLI, use ``kedpm -c``.

Version 0.1.0 (2003-08-20)

    * Added ability to save password database in fpm-compatible format.
    If KedPM detects that it had opened database saved by FPM, it makes
    a backup to ~/.fpm/fpm.kedpm.bak;
    
    * Improved command line interface: overall usability improvements; 
    
    * New cli commands: 'mkdir', 'new', 'edit' and 'save';


Version 0.0.2 (2003-08-05)

    * First public release. All it can do is read Figaro Password
    Manager database files and display passwords to user via cli
    interface;
