Noteworthy changes in Ked Password Manager. Most recent changes are at
the top.

Version 0.4.0 (??)

    * Search entry automatically gets focus, when switching to flat
    view.

    * First password in root category creation bug fixed. GTK warnings
    should be gone too. (SF BUG #862551)

Version 0.3.1 (2003-10-27)

    * Fixed password database initialization problem. New databases
    should be created normally now.

Version 0.3.0 (2003-10-26)

    * Searching is case insensitive (as it should be).

    * Configuration infrastructure implemented. For now only one
    configuration option exists: ``save-mode``.

    * Deleting of passwords implemented.

    * ``rmdir`` and ``mv`` commands were added to CLI (Patch #825957).
    Thanks indygena!

    * Parser feature added. It will help you incorporate passwords from
    your mails to database more efficiently.

    * Support for fpm-0.58 databases with longer passwords (up to
    256 characters). Not tested yet.

    * GUI now can display password as plain text. It is useful when you
    need to send password to someone.

    * Added ability to search whole password tree in one operation. The
    feature accessed through "Flatten" button in GUI and through "-r"
    flag in "show" command in CLI.

    * Various CLI and GUI usability enhancements.

Version 0.2.5 (2003-09-21)

    * Fixed fpm long password bug. Figaro password manager can't handle
    passwords longer that 24 characters. Ked Password manager will allow
    you to save such long passwords, but it will break fpm compatibility
    - fpm will not handle such passwords correctly.

    * GUI now can initialize Figaro database.

Version 0.2.0 (2003-09-14)

    * Added graphical user interface (GUI) frontend

    * Added ability to rename password categories

    * ``kedpm-cli`` script renamed to ``kedpm``. To run GUI, use 
    ``kedpm -g``; to run CLI, use ``kedpm -c``.

Version 0.1.0 (2003-08-20)

    * Added ability to save password database in fpm-compatible format.
    If KedPM detects that it had opened database saved by FPM, it makes
    a backup to ~/.fpm/fpm.kedpm.bak;
    
    * Improved command line interface: overall usability improvements; 
    
    * New cli commands: 'mkdir', 'new', 'edit' and 'save';


Version 0.0.2 (2003-08-05)

    * First public release. All it can do is read Figaro Password
    Manager database files and display passwords to user via cli
    interface;
