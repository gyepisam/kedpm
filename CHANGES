Ked Password Manager: CHANGES 
=============================

Noteworthy changes in Ked Password Manager. Most recent changes are at
the top.

Version 0.4.0 (2004.02.29) 
==========================

    * Search entry automatically gets focus when switching to flat view.

    * First password in root category creation bug fixed. GTK warnings
      should be gone too. (SF BUG #862551)

    * Location of FPM password database file is configurable in options
      ('fpm-database' setting).

    * KedPM has got icons! Artworks made by Eugene Morozov. Thanks
      Eugene!

    * Parser patterns editor added.

    * CLI frontend remembers command history between runs.

    * Support for password trees of arbitrary depth in Figaro
      databases. This feature is not supported by FPM itself, although
      databases with subcategories should still be readable by FPM. (SF
      BUG #845305)

    * Saving history of searches in GUI. The feature is similar to
      browser url bar history.

    * Better completion in CLI.

    * Password list columns in GUI are now sortable and resizable.

Version 0.3.1 (2003-10-27)
==========================

    * Fixed password database initialization problem. New databases
      should be created normally now.

Version 0.3.0 (2003-10-26)
==========================

    * Searching is case insensitive (as it should be).

    * Configuration infrastructure implemented. For now only one
      configuration option exists: ``save-mode``.

    * Deleting of passwords implemented.

    * ``rmdir`` and ``mv`` commands were added to CLI (Patch #825957).
      Thanks indygena!

    * Parser feature added. It will help you incorporate passwords from
      your mails to database more efficiently.

    * Support for fpm-0.58 databases with longer passwords (up to
      256 characters). Not tested yet.

    * GUI now can display password as plain text. It is useful when you
      need to send password to someone.

    * Added ability to search whole password tree in one operation. The
      feature accessed through "Flatten" button in GUI and through "-r"
      flag in "show" command in CLI.

    * Various CLI and GUI usability enhancements.

Version 0.2.5 (2003-09-21)
==========================

    * Fixed fpm long password bug. Figaro password manager can't handle
      passwords longer that 24 characters. Ked Password manager will
      allow you to save such long passwords, but it will break fpm
      compatibility - fpm will not handle such passwords correctly.

    * GUI now can initialize Figaro database.

Version 0.2.0 (2003-09-14)
==========================

    * Added graphical user interface (GUI) frontend

    * Added ability to rename password categories

    * ``kedpm-cli`` script renamed to ``kedpm``. To run GUI, use 
      ``kedpm -g``; to run CLI, use ``kedpm -c``.

Version 0.1.0 (2003-08-20)
==========================

    * Added ability to save password database in fpm-compatible format.
      If KedPM detects that it had opened database saved by FPM, it
      makes a backup to ~/.fpm/fpm.kedpm.bak;
    
    * Improved command line interface: overall usability improvements; 
    
    * New cli commands: 'mkdir', 'new', 'edit' and 'save';

Version 0.0.2 (2003-08-05)
==========================

    * First public release. All it can do is read Figaro Password
      Manager database files and display passwords to user via cli
      interface;
