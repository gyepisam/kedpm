About
=====

Ked Password Manager helps to manage large amounts of passwords and
related information and simplifies tasks of searching and entering
password data.

KedPM written in python and can be run virtually on any platform python
interpreter can run.

KedPM written as extensible framework, which allows to plug in custom
password database back-ends and custom user interface front-ends.
Currently only Figaro PM back-end supported. To manage his passwords,
user can choose between GUI (GTK2 based graphical user interface) and
CLI (Command Line Interface).

Installation
============

Read INSTALL file provided in this distributions for installation
instructions.

Starting Ked Password Manager
=============================

To run Ked Password Manager, issue this command::

    $ kedpm

This will run graphical user interface based on GTK2. Alternatively you
can use kedpm with command line user interface::

    $ kedpm -c

Note: ``kedpm`` program should be located in your PATH.

If you have Figaro Password Manager database KedPM will try to open
it. To do it properly, KedPM will ask you for valid password. 

After the first run KedPM will make a backup of existing fpm database
(located in file ``~/.fpm/fpm``) to file ``~/.fpm.kedpm.bak``. So if fpm
will break for some reason, you will be able to restore your old
database.  Note, however, that database, saved by KedPM itself will not
be backed up.

If you have no Figaro Password Manager database at the moment, KedPM
will try to create one for you. It will ask you for a password to
encrypt password data with. Then KedPM will create empty FPM database.

Command Line Interface
======================

CLI should be quite intuitive for those, who has experience with Linux
shell. Password are placed in categories, like files are placed in
directories. You can move between categories with ``cd`` command, show
contents of category with ``ls`` command, and so on. 

There is one difference however: passwords in database don't have unique
identifiers, like files in filesystem. Passwords in KedPM identified by
their contents. For example, lets say you have a saved a password for
FTP login to your site ``www.homepage.org``. To display that password
all you need to type is ``show homepage``. This command will find the
password, that contain word ``homepage`` in one of its fields, and
display it to you. If KedPM has found several different password records
with that word, you will be able to choose one from the presented list.

Full list of commands can be retrieved with ``help`` command. You can get
help on particular command using ``help <command>``.
