KedPM-0.2.5: How long your passwords are?
=========================================

2003.09.21 This is a bug-fix release. It fixes a major Figaro Password
Manager bug - inability to store long passwords in database. fpm can't
handle passwords longer than 24 characters. KedPM now can, but fpm-0.53
will not load them correctly anyway.

GUI can create new fpm database, if it isn't already exist. Sorry for
those users, who downloaded version 0.2.0, but could not start GUI.


KedPM-0.2.0: Featuring GUI 
===========================

2003.09.14 This release adds support for GTK2 Graphical User Interface.
All features of command line interface are supported, including quick
search.


KedPM-0.1.0 released
====================

2003.08.20 In this release KedPM is able to save passwords to Figaro
Password Manager compatible database. The new version also introduces
ability to add and edit your passwords.

Some other improvements makes this software quite usable.


First release (0.0.2)
=====================

2003.08.05 The first public release of Ked Password Manager. Do not
expect much from this code. This release is basically to make sure that
all necessary infrastructure is in place.

If you have Figaro password database, you may wish to try this software
out. Make sure you've backed up your ~/.fpm/fpm though.
