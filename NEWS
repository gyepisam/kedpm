Ked Password Manager: NEWS
==========================

Ked Password Manager project news. For more detailed list of changes,
see CHANGES file.


KedPM-0.4.0: Everybody must get stoned
======================================

2004.02.29. After a long idling, I've finally found some time to work on
KedPM. 

With this release I've decided to change project status from
alpha to beta. I've used the program quite a lot and it performed great,
so I think its ready for public testing.

Apart bug fixing, this release introduces parser's pattern editor
(without much documentation yet), subcategories of arbitrary depth and
various usability improvements. Figaro Password Manager compatibility is
still in place:)


KedPM-0.3.1
===========

2003.10.27. Kedpm-0.3.0 had a bug that prevented creating of a new
databases. This is fixed in this release. A small fix of a big bug.

KedPM-0.3.0: Meet Parser
========================

2003.10.26 Two major features added in this release. The first is the
Parser feature, that will help you incorporate passwords from your mails
to database more efficiently. Second: ability to search password tree
recursively. It will allow you to search all your passwords in one
operation.

Other updates include experimental fpm-0.58 format support (with it's
longer passwords), basic configuration options, deleting and moving
passwords, ability to display password as plain text in GUI, various
usability enhancements.


KedPM-0.2.5: How long your passwords are?
=========================================

2003.09.21 This is a bug-fix release. It fixes a major Figaro Password
Manager bug - inability to store long passwords in database. fpm can't
handle passwords longer than 24 characters. KedPM now can, but fpm-0.53
will not load them correctly anyway.

GUI can create new fpm database, if it isn't already exist. Sorry for
those users, who downloaded version 0.2.0, but could not start GUI.


KedPM-0.2.0: Featuring GUI 
===========================

2003.09.14 This release adds support for GTK2 Graphical User Interface.
All features of command line interface are supported, including quick
search.


KedPM-0.1.0 released
====================

2003.08.20 In this release KedPM is able to save passwords to Figaro
Password Manager compatible database. The new version also introduces
ability to add and edit your passwords.

Some other improvements makes this software quite usable.


First release (0.0.2)
=====================

2003.08.05 The first public release of Ked Password Manager. Do not
expect much from this code. This release is basically to make sure that
all necessary infrastructure is in place.

If you have Figaro password database, you may wish to try this software
out. Make sure you've backed up your ~/.fpm/fpm though.
