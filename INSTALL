Ked Password Manager: Installation
==================================

Copyright (c) 2003 Andrey Lebedev <andrey at micro.lt>


Prerequisites
=============

To run this software you need:

    * Python interpreter (tested with 2.1.3+, 2.2.3+ and 2.3+; you will
      need python 2.2.x or newer if you want to run GUI)
    * Python Crypto module (http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html)

Additionally, to run GUI you will need:

    * PyGTK 2 - Python Bindings for the GTK Widget Set
      (http://www.daa.com.au/~james/software/pygtk/) 
    * libglade2-0


Running tests
=============

The KedPM distribution contains unit tests. If you want, you can check
the integrity of almost all KedPM components by running ``run_tests``
script in project's root directory. After successful passing of all
tests you will see something like this::

	.................................
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Ran 33 tests in 1.040s
	 
	OK

If some of the test failed - tell me about it. Send me output of this
script and I'll try to fix problem as soon as possible.

	
Installation
============

To install the KedPM support code into your Python tree and
KedPM scripts into /usr/local/bin (substitute that path for whatever is
appropriate on your system). You need to have write permissions
for these locations, e.g. being root on Unix::

    python setup.py install

If you would like to place the KedPM scripts in a directory other than
``/usr/local/bin``, then specify the preferred location with
``--install-script``. For example, to install them in
``/opt/kedpm/bin``::

    python setup.py install --install-scripts=/opt/kedpm/bin

You can also use the ``--prefix`` option to use a completely different
base directory, if you do not want to use administrator rights. If you
choose to do this, take note of the message at the end of installation
and modify the python path accordingly.
