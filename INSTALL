Ked Password Manager: Installation
==================================

Copyright (c) 2003 Andrey Lebedev <andrey at micro.lt>


Prerequisites
=============

To run this software you need:

    * The python interpreter (tested with 2.1.3+, 2.2.3+ and 2.3+; you
      will need Python 2.2.x or newer if you want to run the GUI)
    * The Python Crypto module
      (http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html)

Additionally, to run the GUI you will need:

    * PyGTK 2 - The python bindings for the GTK Widget Set
      (http://www.daa.com.au/~james/software/pygtk/) 
    * libglade2-0


Running tests
=============

The KedPM distribution contains unit tests.  If you want, you can check
the integrity of almost all KedPM components by running ``run_tests``
script in its root directory.  After successfully passing all
tests, you will see something like this::

	.................................
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Ran 33 tests in 1.040s
	 
	OK

If some of the tests fail, tell me about it.  Send me the output of this
script and I'll try to fix the problem, as soon as possible.

	
Installation
============

To install the KedPM support code into your python tree and the KedPM
scripts into ``/usr/local/bin`` (substitute that path with whatever is
appropriate for your system).  You will need to have write permission
for the selected location, e.g: being root on Unix::

    python setup.py install

If you would like to place the KedPM scripts in a directory other than
``/usr/local/bin``, then specify the preferred location with
``--install-script``.  For example, to install them in
``/opt/kedpm/bin``::

    python setup.py install --install-scripts=/opt/kedpm/bin

You can also use the ``--prefix /path/to/install`` option to use a
completely different base directory, if you do not want to use
administrator rights. If you choose to do this, take note of the message
at the end of installation and modify the python path accordingly.
